						<p style="text-align: justify">Japan is a stratovolcanic
							archipelago consisting of about 6,852 islands. The four largest
							are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about
							ninety-seven percent of Japan's land area and often are referred
							to as home islands. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in
							eight regions; Hokkaido being the northernmost prefecture and
							Okinawa being the southernmost one. The population of 127 million
							is the world's eleventh largest. Japanese people make up 98.5% of
							Japan's total population. Approximately 9.1 million people live
							in the city of Tokyo, the capital of Japan.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Archaeological research
							indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper
							Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in
							Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from
							other regions, mainly China, followed by periods of isolation,
							particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan's
							history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by
							successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the
							Emperor.</p>

							<h1>The Samurai</h1>
						</div>
						<p style="text-align: justify">The samurai (or bushi) were the
							warriors of premodern Japan. They later made up the ruling
							military class that eventually became the highest ranking social
							caste of the Edo Period (1603-1867). Samurai employed a range of
							weapons such as bows and arrows, spears and guns, but their main
							weapon and symbol was the sword.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Samurai were supposed to lead
							their lives according to the ethic code of bushido ("the way of
							the warrior"). Strongly Confucian in nature, bushido stressed
							concepts such as loyalty to one's master, self discipline and
							respectful, ethical behavior. Many samurai were also drawn to the
							teachings and practices of Zen Buddhism.</p>
						<div class="pageheader">
							<h1>
								<small>History</small>
							</h1>
						</div>
						<p style="text-align: justify">The samurai trace their origins
							to the Heian Period campaigns to subdue the native Emishi people
							in the Tohoku Region. Around the same time, warriors were
							increasingly hired by wealthy landowners that had grown
							independent of the central government and built armies for their
							own protection.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">The two most powerful of these
							landowning clans, the Minamoto and Taira, eventually challenged
							the central government and battled each other for supremacy over
							the entire country. Minamoto Yoritomo emerged victorious and set
							up a new military government in 1192, led by the shogun or
							supreme military commander. The samurai would rule over Japan for
							most of the next 700 years.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">During the chaotic era of
							warring states in the 15th and 16th centuries, Japan splintered
							into dozens of independent states constantly at war with one
							another. Consequently, warriors were in high demand. It was also
							the era when ninja, warriors specialized in unconventional
							warfare, were most active. Many of the famous samurai movies by
							Kurosawa are set during this time.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">The country was eventually
							reunited in the late 1500s, and a rigid social caste system was
							established during the Edo Period that placed the samurai at the
							top, followed by the farmers, artisans and merchants
							respectively. During this time, the samurai were forced to live
							in castle towns, were the only ones allowed to own and carry
							swords and were paid in rice by their daimyo or feudal lords.
							Masterless samurai were called ronin and caused minor troubles
							during the 1600s.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Relative peace prevailed during
							the roughly 250 years of the Edo Period. As a result, the
							importance of martial skills declined, and many samurai became
							bureaucrats, teachers or artists. Japan's feudal era eventually
							came to an end in 1868, and the samurai class was abolished a few
							years afterwards.</p>

					<h1>Japanese Art</h1>
				</div>
				<img src="images/art.jpg" alt=""
					style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 300px; padding-right: 10px">
				<p style="text-align: justify">Japanese art covers a wide range
					of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture, ink
					painting and calligraphy on silk and paper, ukiyo-e paintings and
					woodblock prints, kirigami, origami, dorodango, and more recently
					manga—modern Japanese cartooning and comics—along with a myriad of
					other types of works of art. It has a long history, ranging from
					the beginnings of human habitation in Japan, sometime in the 10th
					millennium BC, to the present.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">Japan has been subject to sudden
					invasions of new and strange ideas followed by long periods of
					minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese
					developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate
					those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic
					preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the
					7th and 8th centuries in connection with [Buddhism]. In the 9th
					century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop
					indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became
					increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious
					and secular arts flourished. After the Ōnin War (1467–1477), Japan
					entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that
					lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the
					leadership of the Tokugawa shogunate, organized religion played a
					much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that
					survived were primarily secular.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">Painting is the preferred
					artistic expression in Japan, practiced by amateurs and
					professionals alike. Until modern times, the Japanese wrote with a
					brush rather than a pen, and their familiarity with brush
					techniques has made them particularly sensitive to the values and
					aesthetics of painting. With the rise of popular culture in the Edo
					period, a style of woodblock prints became a major form and its
					techniques were fine tuned to produce colorful prints. The
					Japanese, in this period, found sculpture a much less sympathetic
					medium for artistic expression; most Japanese sculpture is
					associated with religion, and the medium's use declined with the
					lessening importance of traditional Buddhism.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">Japanese ceramics are among the
					finest in the world and include the earliest known artifacts of
					their culture. In architecture, Japanese preferences for natural
					materials and an interaction of interior and exterior space are
					clearly expressed.</p>
